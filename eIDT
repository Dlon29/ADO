Euroclear Cash Movement Dashboard – Design Summary

Description (as provided):
A new screen “Euroclear Cash Movement Dashboard” will be added under the "SMTBLUX" menu by replicating the existing “Cash Movement Dashboard” screen & underlying functionality to display verified Repo loan DVP transactions where there are applicable cash movements based on the as-of date (settlement date) selected, for transactions settling at Euroclear only i.e., where Depo is either EURO, EURONI, EUROSL, EUROTL. All the existing logic, message pop-up and screen formatting will also be replicated.

1. Header / Global Behaviour

The screen includes a settlement date selector (defaulting to today), a currency filter, a “Select All” option, and summary counters showing items requiring attention across currencies. Actions include approving transactions, exporting the dashboard to Excel, and viewing/inputting/approving Money Wires.

Section Summaries (a–h)
a. Customer Repo Payments

Displays customer repo transactions (new/returns), showing projected and settled amounts, and enabling approval and Money Wire actions only where applicable; includes special handling for netting preferences and exceptional cases like Gunma.

b. Internal Transfers (Repo)

Provides an informational summary of internal Euroclear funding movements, showing whether funds need to be transferred to Euroclear or Deutsche Bank based on net payable/receivable balances; no user actions required.

c. Customer and Counterparty Pair-Offs

Shows pair-off activity for customers and counterparties where only Payable amounts require user approval and Money Wires, with grouping based on Euroclear-eligible deposits and established wire code/SSI setups.

d. Euroclear Settlement (Bilateral Repo)

Displays bilateral repo settlements for Euroclear, excluding pair-offs, and requires no approval or wire actions since associated movements are covered under Internal Transfers.

e. Reverse Repo

Placeholder section for future Reverse Repo functionality; remains empty until expanded.

f. Triparty Euroclear (DVP)

Lists valid triparty Euroclear DVP transactions for eligible customers, with no wire actions required since Euroclear processes movements automatically.

g. Fails

Shows failed transactions until they settle, updating dashboard sections automatically once resolved and ensuring related cash movements are reflected appropriately.

h. Reconciliation

Provides a bottom-line summary comparing projected versus settled debits and credits for Euroclear and triparty activity, displaying alerts if discrepancies occur.

A new screen under LAVA → SMTB LUX → Maintenance → Euroclear Cash Wire Codes will allow users to maintain Cash Wire Codes used on the Euroclear Cash Movement Dashboard. The screen contains two tabs: Broker Cash Wire Codes and Account Group Cash Wire Codes.

Broker Cash Wire Codes

Users select an existing Broker Number and assign a Cash Wire Code (free text, max 25 characters).

Only one code per Broker Number; edits replace existing values.

The results grid mirrors the current Cash Wire Code maintenance layout and includes a simple filter by Broker Name/Number.

Account Group Cash Wire Codes

Users select an existing Account Group and assign a Cash Wire Code (free text, max 25 characters).

Only one code per Account Group; edits replace existing values.

Includes Customer Preference flags (Display on Dashboard, Netting Option), each with tooltips.

Grid includes a simple filter by Account Group.

5.2.1.3 Euroclear Settlement OPS View – Summary

Enhancements will be made to the existing Euroclear Settlement OPS View screen (LAVA → SMTB LUX → Euroclear Settlement OPS View) to support tracking and updating settlement status.

A new Settlement Status field will be added to both the filter section and results grid, with options All (default), Failed, and Settled.

Settlement Status will update automatically to Settled when the G1 status is Settled; trades in Pending states will not auto-update.

Users will be able to manually mark trades as Failed or Settled using a new Actions drop-down located next to the Apply button; previous-day trades may also be updated.

Any items marked as Failed will appear in the “Fails” section of the Euroclear Cash Movement Dashboard until changed to Settled or Cancelled.

5.2.1.4	ACCOUNT GROUP MAINTENANCE
Navigation: LAVA Home  Maintenance  Account Setup  Account Group
The requirement for enhancement to account group maintenance screen is as follows:
1)	A new attribute label “Masked Prin Name” along with a free textbox, will be added on the screen to store the masked names of SMTBUSA Repo customers.
2)	This new attribute will be displayed on the LAVA – Cash Movement Dashboard, in the column “Name TBD” under the Customer Repo Payments section.

5.2.1.5 SMTBLUX Trifax Report – Summary

The existing Trifax Report (LAVA → Reports → Trifax Report) will be updated to display Market Value instead of Principal Value.

The Open Total and Closing Total columns will now show Market Value.

Column headers Principal/Increase and Principal/Decrease will be renamed to Market/Increase and Market/Decrease in both the Summary and Transaction Details sections, with values updated to reflect Market Value.



Master Activity – Summary of Enhancements

The existing Master Activity screen will be updated to support managing Euroclear settlement status for pair-off trades.

SL Trade Support (SLTS) will receive write access to update Settlement Status directly on the Master Activity screen.

Pair-off Settlement Status will update automatically based on G1 status, but SLTS will manually mark any pair-off Fails.

No new Euroclear-specific Master Activity screen is required; all updates occur in the existing screen.

Euroclear pair-off trades marked as Failed here will appear in the “Fails” section of the Euroclear Cash Movement Dashboard.

Euroclear New/Return trades marked as Failed in the Euroclear Settlement Ops View will also appear in the dashboard’s “Fails” section.

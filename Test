The "Close and Rebook Loans & Collaterals" option will be added below "Cancel and Rebook Loans." A new screen, similar to the existing one, will allow booking returns (PR/SR) and new loans/collaterals in sequence, with settled Sec Lending transactions displayed. Only specific transactions (e.g., Future Loans, Repo Loans) will be excluded. The Transmit Flag will default to "No," and all attributes, except for this flag, will remain unchanged. The "Settlement Date" will default to the current date, and the button label will change to “Close & Rebook.” All other functionality and formatting will be maintained.
